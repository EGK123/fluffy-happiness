# X-Team 09 Style Guide

We will use a style similar to that used in Gary Dahl's CS300 course.

## Naming conventions

We will use standard Java naming conventions. Specifics described below.

### Examples
* interfaces: Capital Case
* classes: Capital Case
* exception types: Capital Case
* fields: Cammel Case
* methods: Cammel Case
* parameters: Cammel Case
* local variables: Cammel Case
* instance constants: All Captial
* class constants: All Capitals

## Commenting style for public and private members of a class or interface:

Comment all member varaibles of a class.

### Examples

* classes: Use Javadocs
* fields: Use inline comments
* constructors: Use Javadocs explaining the purpose for the constructor
* methods: Use Javadocs to describe method and fields
* coding style (brackets, horizontal, and vertical spacing) for:
  * if statements: Always use braces
  * switch statement: Spacing to make the code clear
  * while loops: Spacing to make the code clear
  * for loops: Spacing to make the code clear
  * enhanced for loops: Spacing to make the code clear
