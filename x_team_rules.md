# X-Team 09 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

When assigning tasks if necessary we will group up in person and we will dole out the jobs.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Deadlines. We will create a shared text document on GitHub to share our progress towards our tasks.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Everyone should look over their job within the first couple days of recieving it to find any large difficulties. Asking for help is encouraged.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Deadlines will have a few days buffer between actual due date for class so that we can address any issues.
Encourage others to ask for help--when confused or not--to help streamline productivity and avoid miscommunication. Work as a team to solve problems that are taking longer.
